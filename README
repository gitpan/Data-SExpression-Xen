This module is different than Data::SExpression in its
compatibility. Neither module is currently suitable for
general-purpose S-Expression parsing. This module is very narrowly
developed for compatibility with the S-Expressions generated by Xen.

If this module is useful for other S-Expressions, please let me know!
